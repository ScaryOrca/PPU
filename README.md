# Price Per Unit Calculator

## About
The purpose of this small project is to easily calculate the cost per unit of a product when shopping. Brick and morter stores often place the price per unit on product tags, however, they are many times inaccurate, or use a different unit of measurement across different products. A tag for a small pack of candy may have the price per each piece, while a tag for a larger bag may choose to display the price per ounce. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
